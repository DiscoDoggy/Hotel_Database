# Hotel Database

## Introduction 
Hotel Database is a project mean't to apply the skills gained through learning about database design and implementation of the course of a couple months.
The project uses Java's JDBC library to interface with a Postgres SQL database which the user interfaces with through the command line. The database manages fictional hotels' information from across the world.
The database has two user modes and depending on the type of user, the database grants additional or limited capabilities.
A customer is only able to view specific rooms at a hotel, book a hotel, and see what hotels there are. 
Managers are types of customers who have all the capabilities of a customer but with the additional privilages of being able to hire maintenance from a series of maintenance companies.
